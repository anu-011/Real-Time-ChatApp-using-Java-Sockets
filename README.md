# Chatting Application

A Java-based chatting application built using **Socket Programming**, **Multithreading**, and **Swing GUI**.  
It allows real-time communication between a server and multiple clients.

## Features
- Server-client architecture using sockets  
- Multithreaded server for handling multiple clients  
- Swing-based GUI for chat interface  
- Display of usernames in the chat window  
- Real-time message exchange

## How It Works
1. Start the **Server** application (`Server.java`).  
2. Run the **Client** application (`Client.java`).  
3. Clients connect to the server and exchange messages in real time.  

## Technologies Used
- **Java** (Core Java, Socket API, Multithreading)  
- **Swing** for GUI design  

## Future Enhancements
- User authentication and login  
- Message encryption for secure communication  
- File transfer support  
- Chat history saving
